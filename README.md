 I entered a new empty directory and ran:

git clone git@github.com/DaveChP/test2.git

I entered the newly created directory (a clone of the remote repo) and created this file. I will now add and commit this file to local, branch -M to main and push using these:

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
